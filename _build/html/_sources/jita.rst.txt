Just-in-time administration (JITA) 
==================================
Just-in-time administration (JITA) is an approach for minimizing the privileged account attack vector in a security strategy, combined with a precise definition of assigned authorizations. Every time an eligible users needs to perform a task which requires membership in privileged groups, they enable such membership for defined period of time. The membership expire after a specified time period, so that a malicious user can't steal the access.
